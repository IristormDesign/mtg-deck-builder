		<h4>Deck Menu</h4>
		<p>When you click the Open Deck button in the <a href="#m-app-header">app header</a>, the deck menu appears. It lists of all of your currently unopened decks, in alphabetical order by name, that are <a href="#m-storage-of-deck-data">stored</a> in MTG Deck Builder.</p>
		<p>Beside each deck’s name are the <a href="#m-symbols">symbols</a> of the mana colors required by the deck’s spells, ordered from the most frequent color to the least.</p>
		<p>If you’re using MTG Deck Builder on a mobile device, then the deck menu appears as a section within the whole menu of the app header instead of as a separate menu.</p>
		<p>Each deck listed in the deck menu is a link that takes you to the respective <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		<p>When you start MTG Deck Builder for the first time ever, two sample decks (“Boros Equipment” and “Sultai Ramp”) are provided. You may modify these decks however you like or <a href="#m-deck-actions">delete</a> them.</p>
		<p>If all decks in the app have been deleted, then the Open Deck button in the app header becomes temporarily disabled until you <a href="#m-create-deck">create a deck</a>.</p>
