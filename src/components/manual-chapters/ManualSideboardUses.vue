		<h5>Sideboard Uses</h5>
		<p>The sideboard <a href="#m-group-switch">card group</a> contains cards that are related to your deck, but are not part of your deck’s main card group. In MTG Deck Builder, you could use the sideboard for any of these purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Temporarily substitute certain cards in the main group with certain cards in the sideboard. This would be done before a rematch with an opponent whose deck has known strengths and weaknesses particularly against your deck.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When you’re making a new deck, the sideboard can hold cards you’re considering to put in the main group, but that you haven’t firmly decided on yet. For this purpose, the sideboard is helpful because the cards in it don’t affect your <a href="#m-deck-statistics">deck’s statistics</a> (except Last Edit).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Some cards have abilities that specially let you get cards from “outside the game.” The sideboard can contain the outside cards that you intend to play with your deck.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
