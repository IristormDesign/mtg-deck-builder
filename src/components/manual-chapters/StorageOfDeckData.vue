		<h3>Storage of Deck Data</h3>
		<p>In MTG Deck Builder, the data for your decks is stored only in your web browser’s local data cache. The data isn’t stored in a remote database through the Internet.</p>
		<p>Basically, that means the following conditions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Anyone can create and save decks in MTG Deck Builder right away, without ever needing to register for a user account.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The custom decks you’ve made in MTG Deck Builder are available only in the particular web browser on the particular computer or phone on which you’ve made those decks. If you’d need to access your decks elsewhere, you can transfer their data from the source location by <a href="#archive-action">archiving your decks</a> beforehand, then <a href="#create-deck-page">reproducing the archived decks</a> in the other location.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Similarly, other users of MTG Deck Builder on their own web browsers can’t view your decks, or you theirs—except by sharing <a href="#deck-archive-files">deck archive files</a>, or by the list-sharing methods via the <a href="#text-renderer">Text Renderer mode</a>.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<h4>Deck Archive Files</h4>
			<p>A deck archive file is a file that has data for certain decks <a href="#archive-action">archived</a> by a user of MTG Deck Builder. A single deck archive can contain data for any number of decks.</p>
			<p>You might want to have a deck archive file for any of the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Send the archive file to other users of MTG Deck Builder to let them see the decks you’ve made, or vice versa.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Keep the archive file as a backup copy of all your decks. You should want a backup copy in case you somehow lose access to your decks’ original <a href="#storage-of-deck-data">stored data</a> in your web browser on your computer or phone.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use the archive to migrate all your decks from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To make an archive file of any of your decks, click the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions button</a> in the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a>, which makes a menu appear. From that menu, select the “Archive&hellip;” option.</p>
			<p>To view the decks contained in an archive, go to the <a href="#create-deck">Create Deck page</a>. From there, click the button in the “Reproduce Archived Decks” section, which lets you find and open a deck archive through the file browser of your computer or phone.</p>
