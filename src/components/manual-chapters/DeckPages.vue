		<h3>Deck Pages</h3>
		<p>Deck pages are the central focus of MTG Deck Builder: They’re where you construct, analyze, test, and modify the contents of your <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> decks.</p>
		<p>Every deck in the app has its own deck page. Whenever you <a href="#m-create-deck">create</a> or <a href="#m-deck-menu">open</a> a deck, you’re directed to its deck page.</p>

		</p>
		<p>A deck page’s contents has two major sections—the <a href="#m-deck-page-header">deck page header</a> and the <a href="#m-deck-page-modes">deck page mode</a> section—and both of them are subdivided into sections of their own. The next chapters of this user manual explain in detail every section of a deck page.</p>
		<p>Whenever you’re viewing a deck page, you’re optionally able to use special <a href="#m-keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>, which let you do commands by pressing keys on a keyboard.</p>
