		<h4>Deck Views</h4>
		<p>The deck view section, positioned under the <a href="#m-deck-page-header">deck page header</a>, displays any one of three “deck views” at a time. These deck views are called <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>, <a href="#m-more-stats">More Statistics</a>, and <a href="#m-draw-sim">Draw Simulator</a>, and each provides you a different utility.</p>
		<p>The following chapters of this user manual explain how each view works.</p>
