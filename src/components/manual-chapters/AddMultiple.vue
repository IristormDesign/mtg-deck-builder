		<h4>“Add Multiple” Button</h4>
		<p>Click the “Add Multiple” button, located next to the <a href="#card-adder">card adder</a> in the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>, to go to the <a href="#card-list-entry">Card List Entry page</a>.</p>

			<h5>Card List Entry Page</h5>
			<p>When you create a <a href="#create-deck">new deck</a>, you might already know many or all of the certain cards you’re going to include in it. Or, maybe you’ve copied the card list of a <i>Magic</i> deck from a source outside MTG Deck Builder, and you’d like to interact with that deck inside MTG Deck Builder.</p>
			<p>In either of those cases, you could build the deck with the <a href="#card-adder">card adder tool</a>, inserting each of the card names one by one. However, a faster way is to instead write a list of all the known card names together. To do that, first click the <a href="#add-multiple">“Add Multiple” button</a> in the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>, which takes you to the Card List Entry page.</p>
			<p>The Card List Entry page features a submission form. In the form, write a list of the names of <i>Magic</i> cards that you want to have in your deck, preceding each name with a number for its <a href="#card-quantities">quantity</a>.</p>
			<p>The page provides you instructions on how to write a card list in the accepted list format. (This format is the same one used for card lists generated by the <a href="#text-renderer">Text Renderer</a>.) It’s important you exactly follow that format, or else the names in your list may fail to be added to your deck. The app ignores any single lines of a list that don’t match the accepted format, while still accepting the other lines.</p>
			<p>You can also use the Card List Entry page’s submission form to change the quantities of any names that already exist in your deck’s main <a href="#card-groups">card group</a>. Setting a name’s quantity to 0 will remove that name from the group.</p>
			<p>When you’re done, click the “Add Cards” button to submit your list in the form. You’ll then be shown an overview of the submission results. It tells you about every entry from your submitted list, and whether the app was able to get the card names from those entries—and, if not, with the reasons why.</p>
			<p>Your valid submitted names are added to the main card group of your deck.</p>
