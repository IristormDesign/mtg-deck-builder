		<h4>“Add Multiple” Button</h4>
		<p>The “Add multiple” button is a button located next to the <a href="#card-adder">card adder</a> in the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>. Click it to go to the <a href="#card-list-entry">Card List Entry page</a>.</p>

			<h5>Card List Entry Page</h5>
			<p>When you create a <a href="#create-deck">new deck</a>, you might already know many or all of the certain cards you’re going to include in it. Or, maybe you’ve copied the card list for a <i>Magic</i> deck from a source outside MTG Deck Builder, and you’d like to interact with that deck inside MTG Deck Builder.</p>
			<p>In either of those cases, you could build the deck with the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>’s <a href="#card-adder">card adder</a> tool, putting each of the card names into the deck one by one. However, a faster way instead is to go to the Card List Entry page, which you can do by clicking the <a href="#add-multiple">“Add multiple” button</a> in the List Editor.</p>
			<p>The Card List Entry page features a submission form. In this form, you can write a list of multiple names of <i>Magic</i> cards, along with assigning the quantity to each of the names. Then, click the “Add Cards” button to submit the form, which adds those submitted cards to the main <a href="#card-groups">card group</a> of your deck.</p>
			<p>You can also use the submission form to edit the quantities of any card names that already exist in your deck’s main card group. Setting a name’s quantity to 0 will remove that name from the main group.</p>
			<p>The Card List Entry page provides you instructions on how to write a card list in the accepted list format. (This format is the same one used for card lists generated by the <a href="#text-renderer">Text Renderer</a>.) It’s important you exactly follow that format, or else the card names in your list may fail to be added to your deck. The app ignores any single lines of your list that don’t match the accepted format.</p>
			<p>Once you submit a list from the Card List Entry page, you’ll then be shown the results page. It tells you about every entry from your submitted list, and whether the entries successfully added the cards to your deck, and, if not, with the reasons why.</p>
