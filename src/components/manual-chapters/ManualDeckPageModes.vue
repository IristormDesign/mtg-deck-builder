		<h4>Deck Page Modes</h4>
		<p>A <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> displays any one of three “deck page modes” at a time. These modes are called <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>, <a href="#m-more-stats">More Statistics</a>, and <a href="#m-draw-sim">Draw Simulator</a>, and each is a different way you can interact with your deck in the app.</p>
		<p>The subsequent chapters of this user manual explain in detail how each mode works.</p>
		<p>Whenever you arrive on any deck page, the Deck Editor is the mode shown first. You can use the <a href="#m-modes-menu">modes menu</a> to set the deck page from one mode to another.</p>
