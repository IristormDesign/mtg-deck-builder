		<h5>Card Bars</h5>
		<p>Card bars resemble the bar-shaped graphic elements depicted on modern <i>Magic</i> cards where the cards’ names and mana costs are printed on.</p>

		<p>In the <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>’s <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a>, card bars represent the certain names of <i>Magic</i> cards in your deck’s active <a href="#m-card-groups">card group</a>. Each bar is labeled with the following characteristics of the card it represents:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Name</li>
			<li>Mana cost (if any)</li>
			<li>Type, including supertype and/or subtype (if any)</li>
			<li>Rarity</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For a card that’s double-faced or split, its bar displays the characteristics of both faces with “&nbsp;//&nbsp;” (two slashes) inserted in between.</p>
		<p>Click any card bar to <a href="#m-card-image">view that card’s image</a>.</p>
		<p>The color of each card bar’s surface represents the mana color of that card. For example, the bar color for mono-green spells is green. Moreover, the bar color for multicolored spells is gold, for colorless spells is gray, and for lands is brown.</p>
