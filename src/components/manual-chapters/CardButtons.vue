		<p>In the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a>, each card name is represented by a wide button, and each button is labeled with the following characteristics of the card:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Name</li>
			<li>Mana cost (if any)</li>
			<li>Type, including supertype and/or subtype (if any)</li>
			<li>Rarity</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For a card that’s double-faced or split, its button displays the characteristics of both faces with “&nbsp;//&nbsp;” (two slashes) inserted in between.</p>
		<p>Click any card button to <a href="#m-card-image">view that card’s image</a>.</p>
		<p>The color of each card button’s surface represents that card’s mana colors. For example, the button color for mono-green spells is green. Moreover, the button color for multicolored spells is gold, for colorless spells is gray, and for lands is brown.</p>
