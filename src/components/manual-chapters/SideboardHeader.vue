		<h4>Sideboard Header</h4>
		<p>In the <a href="#deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>, the sideboard header is a brown banner with the word “Sideboard” on it. Though it’s normally hidden, it becomes visible above the <a href="#card-list">card list</a> whenever you set the <a href="#card-groups">card group switch</a> to the sideboard option.</p>
		<p>The sideboard header also shows the total number of cards contained within your <a href="#sideboard-uses">deck’s sideboard</a>. If there are more than 15 cards, which is the maximum limit for sideboards according to <a href="#game-rules"><i>Magic</i>’s rules</a>, then a “⚠” (warning symbol) appears beside the total.</p>
