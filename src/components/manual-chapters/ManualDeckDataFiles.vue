		<h4>Deck Data Files</h4>
		<p>These are files that contain data for certain decks made with MTG Deck Builder by you or other users. A single deck data file can have data for any number of decks.</p>
		<p>You might export or import a deck data file for any of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Send the file to other users of MTG Deck Builder to let them see the decks you’ve made, or vice versa.</li>
			<li>Keep the file as a backup copy of your decks, in case you somehow lose access to your original deck data in your computer or device.</li>
			<li>Move your decks from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</li>
			<li>If you’d ever need to empty your web browser’s data cache, then all of your decks in MTG Deck Builder, whose data is stored in the cache, will be gone. You can preserve your decks by exporting them as a deck data file beforehand.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To make a data file of a deck, go to the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck’s page</a>, and then from the <a href="#m-deck-actions">deck actions</a> menu, select the Export option.</p>
		<p>To view a deck from exported data, go to the <a href="#m-create-deck">Create Deck page</a> and click on the button in the “Import Decks” section. This lets you find and open a deck data file from the file system of your computer or device.</p>
