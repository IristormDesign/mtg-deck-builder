		<h4>Deck Data Files</h4>
		<p>These are files that contain data for particular decks that have been made in MTG Deck Builder. The app includes functions for you to export and import deck data files.</p>
		<p>You might want to export a deck data file for any of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Show other users of MTG Deck Builder a deck you’ve made by providing them the deck data file.</li>
			<li>Move your deck from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</li>
			<li>If you’d ever need to empty your web browser’s data cache, then all of your decks in MTG Deck Builder, whose data is stored in the cache, will be gone. You can preserve your decks by exporting them as a deck data file beforehand.</li>
			<li>Keep the file as a backup copy of your deck’s data, in case you somehow lose access to your original deck data in your computer/device or web browser.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To make a data file of a deck, go to the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck’s page</a>, and then from the <a href="#m-deck-actions">deck actions</a> menu, select the Export option.</p>
		<p>To view a deck from exported data, go to the <a href="#m-create-deck">Create Deck page</a> and click on the button in the “Import a Deck” section. This lets you find and open a deck data file from the file system of your computer or device.</p>
