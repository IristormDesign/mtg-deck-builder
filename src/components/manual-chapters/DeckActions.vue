		<h4>Deck Actions</h4>
		<p>In the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a> is a button labeled “Deck Actions&hellip;.” Click it to display a drop-down menu with options that let you do special actions to your decks. These options are “<a href="#duplicate-action">duplicate</a>,” “<a href="#export-action">export</a>,” and “<a href="#delete-action">delete</a>,” and their effects are explained in the next subchapters.</p>

		<section id="duplicate-action">
			<h5>Duplicate</h5>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Duplicate” option to create another whole deck that’s an identical copy of the <a href="#deck-menu">deck you’re currently viewing</a> at the time of duplication. The app prompts you to give the duplicate deck a <a href="#deck-name">unique name</a>.</p>
			<p>Immediately after duplicating, you’re directed to the duplicate’s <a href="#deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="export-action">
			<h5>Export</h5>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Export” option to go to the “Export Decks” page. From there, you can select any of your decks in MTG Deck Builder to “export,” which means to have the app generate a <a href="#deck-data-files">deck data file</a> for those decks. The file is saved on your computer or mobile device to wherever your web browser puts downloads.</p>
			<p>Once you have a deck data file, you—or anyone whom you give the file to—can later “<a href="#create-deck">import</a>” it, which means to have the app recreate the decks from the data contained in that file.</p>
			<p>If you export a single deck alone, then the deck data file is named after that deck’s name. If you export multiple decks together, then the file is named “My Decks.” In either case, the file has “.deck” as its file extension.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="delete-action">
			<h5>Delete</h5>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Delete” option to go to the “Delete Decks” page. From there, you can select any of your decks to permanently remove from your web browser’s <a href="#storage-of-deck-data">data storage</a> for MTG Deck Builder.</p>
			<p>After a deck is deleted, if you’d try to go back to the URL that had belonged to that <a href="#deck-pages">deck’s page</a>, then you’d be redirected to a “Page Not Found” error page instead.</p>
