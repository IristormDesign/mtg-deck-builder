		<h4>Deck Actions</h4>
		<p>In the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a>, click the “Deck Actions” button to display a drop-down menu with options that let you do special actions to your decks. These options are “<a href="#duplicate-action">duplicate</a>,” “<a href="#archive-action">archive</a>,” and “<a href="#delete-action">delete</a>,” and their effects are explained in the next subchapters.</p>

		<section id="duplicate-action">
			<h5>Duplicate</h5>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Duplicate” option to create another whole deck that’s an identical copy of the <a href="#deck-menu">deck you’re currently viewing</a> at the time of duplication. The app prompts you to give the duplicate deck a <a href="#deck-name">unique name</a>.</p>
			<p>Immediately after duplicating, you’re directed to the duplicate’s <a href="#deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="archive-action">
			<h5>Archive</h5>
			<p>In MTG Deck Builder, to “archive” means to have the app generate a <a href="#deck-archive-files">deck archive file</a>, which is a file that has the complete copied data of your decks. When you have a deck archive file, you—or anyone whom you give the file to—can later <a href="#create-deck">reproduce the decks</a> from its data.</p>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Archive&hellip;” option to go to the “Archive Decks” page. From there, select one or more of your decks to archive. The deck archive file is saved on your computer or phone to wherever your web browser puts downloads.</p>
			<p>If you archive one deck alone, the archive file is automatically named after that deck’s name. If you archive multiple decks together, the file is automatically named “My Decks.” In either case, “.deck” is its file extension.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="delete-action">
			<h5>Delete</h5>
			<p>In the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> menu, select the “Delete” option to go to the “Delete Decks” page. From there, you can select any of your decks to permanently remove from your web browser’s <a href="#storage-of-deck-data">data storage</a> for MTG Deck Builder.</p>
			<p>After a deck is deleted, if you’d try to go back to the URL that had belonged to that <a href="#deck-pages">deck’s page</a>, then you’d be redirected to a “Page Not Found” error page instead.</p>
