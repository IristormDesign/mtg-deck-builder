		<h4>Decks Menu</h4>
		<p>When you click on the Open Deck button in the <a href="#m-app-header">app header</a>, the decks menu appears. It lists of all of your currently unopened decks, in alphabetical order by name, that are <a href="#m-storage-of-deck-data">stored</a> in MTG Deck Builder. Beside each deck’s name are the <a href="#m-symbols">symbols</a> of the mana colors required by the deck’s spells.</p>
		<p>If you’re using MTG Deck Builder on a mobile device, then the decks menu may appear as part of the whole app header’s menu instead of a separate menu.</p>
		<p>Each deck listed in the decks menu is a link that takes you to the respective <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		<p>If all decks in the app have been deleted, the Open Deck button in the app header becomes temporarily disabled.</p>
