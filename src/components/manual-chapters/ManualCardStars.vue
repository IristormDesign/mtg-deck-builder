		<h5>Card Stars</h5>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder provides you the option to “star” card names—that is, you can attach a label of a “★” (star symbol) to any names you choose in the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a>. A card name’s star label appears directly to the left of the <a href="#m-card-buttons">card button</a>.</p>
		<p>You might star certain card names that you think should have special attention over the rest. For example, you could star the one or two names that are most essential to your deck’s strategy. In a deck built for the Commander game variant, you could star the name that’s designated the commander.</p>
		<p>To star a card name, click the blank space just to the left side of the card button. To un-star a card name, click the star label.</p>
