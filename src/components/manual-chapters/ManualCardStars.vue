		<h5>Card Stars</h5>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder provides you the option to “star” cards—that is, you can attach a label of “★” (a star symbol) to any cards you choose in the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a>. A card’s star label appears directly to the left of the <a href="#m-card-buttons">card button</a>.</p>
		<p>You might star certain cards that you think should have special attention over the rest. For example, you could star the one or two cards that are most essential to your deck’s strategy. In a deck built for the Commander game variant, you could star the card that’s designated the commander.</p>
		<p>To star a card, click on the blank space just to the left side of the card button. To un-star a card, click on the star label.</p>
