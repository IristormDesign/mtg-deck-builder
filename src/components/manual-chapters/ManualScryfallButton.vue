		<h4>Scryfall Advanced Search Button</h4>
		<p> With the overwhelming number of cards that exist in <i>Magic</i>, how can you know which ones to consider for your deck? A helpful tool for this is <a href="https://scryfall.com/advanced" target="_blank">Scryfall’s advanced search</a>, where you can browse through a filtered list of <i>Magic</i> cards that only match the combination of attributes you specify.</p>
		<p>On <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck pages</a> in MTG Deck Builder, there’s a button labeled with the Scryfall logo. You can click that button to be taken directly to Scryfall’s advanced search page, which opens in a new browser tab.</p>
		<p>(Note that Scryfall is a separate website from MTG Deck Builder, and Iristorm Design is not affiliated with Scryfall.)</p>
		<p>If you’re using the advanced search on Scryfall and you find a good card for your deck, you can then return to MTG Deck Builder and enter that card’s name in the <a href="#m-card-adder">card adder</a>.</p>
