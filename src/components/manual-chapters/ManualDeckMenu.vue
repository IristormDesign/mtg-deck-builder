		<h4>Deck Menu</h4>
		<p>When you click on the Open Deck button in the <a href="#m-app-header">app header</a>, the deck menu appears. It lists of all of your currently unopened decks, in alphabetical order by name, that are <a href="#m-storage-of-deck-data">stored</a> in MTG Deck Builder. Beside each deck’s name are the <a href="#m-symbols">symbols</a> of the mana colors required by the deck’s spells.</p>
		<p>If you’re using MTG Deck Builder on a mobile device, then the deck menu appears as part of the whole app header’s menu instead of a separate menu.</p>
		<p>Each deck listed in the deck menu is a link that takes you to the respective <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		<p>When you start MTG Deck Builder for the first time ever, it provides two sample decks (“Boros Equipment” and “Sultai Ramp”). You may modify these decks however you like or delete them.</p>
		<p>If all decks in the app have been <a href="#m-deck-actions">deleted</a>, the Open Deck button in the app header becomes temporarily disabled.</p>
