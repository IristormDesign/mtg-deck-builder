		<h3>Deck Page Modes</h3>
		<p>A <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> is set to any one of three deck page modes at a time. These modes are called <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>, <a href="#m-deck-analyzer">Deck Analyzer</a>, and <a href="#m-draw-sim">Draw Simulator</a>, and each provides you a different way to interact with your deck in the app.</p>
		<p>The next chapters of this user manual explain in detail how each mode works.</p>
		<p>A modeâ€™s contents appears below the <a href="#m-deck-page-header">deck page header</a>. Whenever you go to any deck page, the mode displayed first is the Deck Editor. Use the <a href="#m-mode-menu">mode menu</a> or <a href="#m-kbsc-deck-page-modes">keyboard shortcuts</a> to switch from one mode to another anytime.</p>
