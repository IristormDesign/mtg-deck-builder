		<h4>Deck Page Modes</h4>
		<p>A <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> displays any one of three “deck page modes” at a time. These modes are called <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a>, <a href="#m-more-stats">More Statistics</a>, and <a href="#m-draw-sim">Draw Simulator</a>, and each provides you a different way to interact with your deck in the app.</p>
		<p>The subsequent chapters of this user manual explain in detail how each deck page mode works.</p>
		<p>A mode’s content appears below the <a href="#m-deck-page-header">deck page header</a>. Whenever you arrive on any deck page, the mode shown first is the Deck Editor. You can use the <a href="#m-modes-menu">modes menu</a> to switch from one mode to another anytime.</p>
