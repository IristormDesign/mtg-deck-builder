		<h4>Deck Archive Files</h4>
		<p>Deck archive files are files that contain data for certain decks made with MTG Deck Builder by you or other users. An archive can have data for one or more decks.</p>
		<p>You might want to have a deck archive file for any of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Send the file to other users of MTG Deck Builder to let them see the decks you’ve made, or vice versa.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Keep the file as a backup copy of all your decks in case you somehow lose access to your original deck data in your computer or phone.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Migrate all your decks from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If you’d ever empty your web browser’s data cache, then all of your decks in MTG Deck Builder, whose data is stored in the cache, will be gone. Preserve your decks by having them as copies in a deck archive file.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To make an archive file of any of your decks, click the <a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions</a> button in the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a>, which makes a menu appear. From that menu, select the “Archive&hellip;” option.</p>
		<p>To view the decks contained in an archive, go to the <a href="#create-deck">Create Deck page</a>. From there, click the button in the “Reproduce Archived Decks” section, which lets you find and open a deck archive file from the file system of your computer or phone.</p>
