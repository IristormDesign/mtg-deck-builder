		<h4>Statistics Filter</h4>
		<p>For almost any table row, you can click on it to start a statistics filter for the card attribute relevant to that row. The filter temporarily hides any statistics about the cards in your deck that don’t match the particular attribute you’ve selected to filter. Furthermore, the total cards and percentages counted within each category are automatically recounted for only the currently filtered cards.</p>
		<p>A banner at the top of the Deck Analyzer lets you know when a filter is active or not, and which specific card attribute (if any) is being filtered. The table row pertaining to the currently filtered attribute appears shaded blue with a dashed outline, contrasting from the appearance of all other table rows.</p>
		<p>To turn off the filter, do any of the following actions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Click on the table row for the currently filtered card attribute.</li>
			<li>From the filter banner, click the “Stop Filter” button.</li>
			<li><a href="#m-keyboard-shortcuts">Press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key</a>.</li>
		</ul>
