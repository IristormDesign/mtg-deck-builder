		<h3>Text Renderer</h3>
		<p>The Text Renderer is a <a href="#deck-page-modes">deck page mode</a> where you can view the cards in your deck’s <a href="#card-groups">main and sideboard groups</a> in the form of simplified lists in plain text.</p>
		<p>These plain-text card lists have one card name per line, with each name preceded by its <a href="#card-quantities">quantity</a>. (This textual card list format is the same one used for <a href="#card-list-entry">adding card lists</a> to your deck.)</p>
		<p>Why would you want to see your deck in the form of plain text?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Shop online faster for your deck’s cards.</strong> On some online stores that sell <i>Magic</i> card singles, they provide you a way to search for a list of cards at once. Stores may call this list-searching method “mass entry,” “deck builder,” etc. You can copy your plain-text deck lists from this app, then paste it into an online store’s mass entry search.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Print out your deck lists.</strong> A text document is better suited for printing on paper than the web page of the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Share over the Internet.</strong> Plain-text card lists are in a human-readable format that doesn’t require other people to use MTG Deck Builder, unlike <a href="#deck-data-files">deck data files</a>. (However, a deck data file can <a href="#export-action">export</a> and import multiple decks together, and includes extra data about decks that a plain-text list lacks.)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you want to take these plain-text card lists outside MTG Deck Builder, there are easy ways to do that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>You can download a text (.txt) file that lists the cards in both the main and sideboard groups of your deck. The file is saved to wherever your web browser puts downloads.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>For either the main or the sideboard group of your deck, you can click the Copy button beside the list to instantly select and copy the whole text list to the clipboard of your computer or mobile device. (Then you can paste it elsewhere.)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The order of card names in the Text Renderer’s card lists matches that of the List Editor’s <a href="#card-list">card lists</a>. If you care about the order, use the List Editor’s <a href="#card-sorter">card sorter</a> to rearrange the names in the way you prefer before you <a href="#mode-menu">switch to</a> the Text Renderer.</p>
