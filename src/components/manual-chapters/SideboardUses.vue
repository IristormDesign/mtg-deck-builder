		<h5>Sideboard Uses</h5>
		<p>The sideboard is a <a href="#m-card-groups">card group</a> containing cards that are related to your deck, but that aren’t in your deck’s main card group. In MTG Deck Builder, you could use the sideboard for any of these purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Temporarily swap certain cards in the main card group with ones in the sideboard. You’d typically do this before a rematch with an opponent whose deck you’ve realized has strengths and weaknesses against yours.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>When you’re in the process of making a new deck, the sideboard group can hold cards you’re considering to put in the main group, but that you haven’t firmly decided on yet. For this use, the sideboard can be helpful because the cards in it don’t affect your <a href="#m-basic-statistics">deck’s statistics</a>, except for Last Edit.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Some cards have abilities that specially let you get cards from “outside the game.” The sideboard can contain the outside cards that you intend to play with your deck.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of the three <a href="#m-deck-page-modes">deck page modes</a>, only the <a href="#m-deck-editor">Deck Editor</a> uses the sideboard.</p>
