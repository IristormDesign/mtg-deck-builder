		<h4>Scryfall Advanced Search Button</h4>
		<p>The vast amount of distinct cards that exist in all of <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> is overwhelming. So, how can you reasonably know which ones to consider for your deck? A helpful assistant for this is <a href="https://scryfall.com/advanced" target="_blank">Scryfall’s advanced card search</a>, where you can browse through a filtered list of <i>Magic</i> cards matching only the combination of attributes you specify.</p>
		<p>In the <a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>, there’s a button labeled with the Scryfall logo and the text “Card search.” Click that button to be taken directly to the page for Scryfall’s advanced search, which opens in a new browser tab. Alternatively, <a href="#keyboard-shortcuts">press the <span class="no-text-break"><kbd class="shift-key">Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd></span> keys</a> to do that same action.</p>
		<p>(Note that Scryfall is a separate website from MTG Deck Builder, and Iristorm Design has no affiliation with Scryfall.)</p>
		<p>Although MTG Deck Builder has been designed to be used alongside searches on Scryfall, it’s not required. You can instead use any other search engine for <i>Magic</i> cards, such as <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Gatherer</a>, or most online stores that sell <i>Magic</i> card singles.</p>
		<p>Whenever you find a good card for your deck from your search, you can then return to MTG Deck Builder and enter that card’s name in the <a href="#card-adder">card adder</a>.</p>
