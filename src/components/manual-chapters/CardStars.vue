		<h5>Card Stars</h5>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder provides you the option to “star” card names—that is, you can attach a label of a “★” (star symbol) to any names you choose in the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a>. A card name’s star label appears directly to the left of the <a href="#m-card-buttons">card button</a>.</p>
		<p>You might star certain card names that you think should have special attention over the rest. For example, you could star the one or two names that are most essential to your deck’s strategy. In a deck built for the Commander (or EDH) format, you could star the name of the designated commander card.</p>
		<p>To star a card name, click the blank space just to the left side of the card button. To un-star a card name, click the star label. Alternatively, press the <kbd>A</kbd> key to star and un-star the card name in the row that’s been highlighted via <a href="#m-keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
		<p>If your deck has at least one card name that’s starred, then the next time you open the deck, the last starred card you had viewed will have its <a href="#m-card-image">card image</a> shown.</p>
