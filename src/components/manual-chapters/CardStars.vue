		<h5>Card Stars</h5>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder provides you the option to “star” card names—that is, you can attach a label of a “★” (star symbol) to any names you choose in the <a href="#card-list">card list</a>. The star label for a card name appears directly to the left of the <a href="#card-bars">card bar</a>.</p>
		<p>You might want to star certain card names that you think should have special attention over the others in a card list. For example, you could star the one or two names that are most essential to your deck’s strategy. In a deck built for the Commander (or EDH) format, you could star the name of the designated commander card.</p>
		<p>To star a card name, click the blank space just to the left side of the card bar. To un-star a name, click the star label. Alternatively, press the <kbd>A</kbd> key to star and un-star the name in the card list row that’s highlighted via <a href="#keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
		<p>If your deck has at least one card name that’s starred, then the next time you open the deck, the last starred card you had viewed will have its <a href="#card-image">card image</a> shown.</p>
