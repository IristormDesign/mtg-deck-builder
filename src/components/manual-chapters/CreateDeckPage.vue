		<h3>Create Deck Page</h3>
		<p>The Create Deck page is where you can start on a new deck or import a pre-made deck. Either method adds the deck to the <a href="#m-deck-menu">deck menu</a>.</p>
		<p>If you choose to start a new deck, you first give it a name, then the app takes you to an empty <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> for that deck.</p>
		<p>If you have a <a href="#m-deck-data-files">deck data file</a> (.deck) for MTG Deck Builder, you can import it through the Create Deck page. Then the app instantly produces the decks from that file.</p>
		<p>Every deck you have in the app must have a unique name. When you’re starting a new deck, if you happen to submit a name that another one of your decks already has, then you’ll be asked to give a different name instead.</p>
		<p>Or, if you import a deck with the same name as an existing deck, then the imported deck’s name will automatically have a unique number within parentheses appended to it. (You could <a href="#m-deck-name">rename</a> it afterward.)</p>
