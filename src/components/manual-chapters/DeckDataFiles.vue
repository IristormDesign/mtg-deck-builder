		<h4>Deck Data Files</h4>
		<p>These are files that contain data for certain decks made with MTG Deck Builder by you or other users. A single deck data file can have data for multiple decks.</p>
		<p>You might export or import a deck data file for any of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Send the file to other users of MTG Deck Builder to let them see the decks you’ve made, or vice versa.</li>
			<li>Keep the file as a backup copy of your decks, in case you somehow lose access to your original deck data in your computer or mobile device.</li>
			<li>Move your decks from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</li>
			<li>If you’d ever empty your web browser’s data cache, then all of your decks in MTG Deck Builder, whose data is stored in the cache, will be gone. You can preserve your decks by exporting them as a deck data file beforehand.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To export a deck (produce a deck data file), click the “<a href="#deck-actions">Deck Actions&hellip;</a>” button (in the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a>), then from the menu that appears, select Export.</p>
		<p>To import a deck (view a deck contained in a deck data file), go to the <a href="#create-deck">Create Deck page</a>. From there, click the button in the Import Decks section, which lets you find and open a deck data file from the file system of your computer or mobile device.</p>
