		<h4>Deck Data Files</h4>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder includes functions for exporting and importing deck data files, which are files that contain data for particular decks that have been made by you or other users of this app.</p>
		<p>You might want to export a deck data file for any of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Show other users of MTG Deck Builder the deck you’ve made by sending them your deck’s data file.</li>
			<li>Store the file as a backup copy of your deck’s data, in case your computer/device or web browser somehow causes you to lose your original deck data from the app.</li>
			<li>Move your deck from one web browser to another (if you’re switching your preferred browser, for example).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To produce a data file of a deck, go to the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck’s page</a>, and then from the <a href="#m-deck-actions">deck actions</a> menu, select the “Export” option.</p>
		<p>To make a deck from exported data, go to the <a href="#m-create-deck">Create Deck page</a> and click on the button in the “Import a Deck” section. This lets you find and open a deck data file from your computer or device’s file system.</p>
