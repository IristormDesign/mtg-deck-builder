		<h4>Decks Menu</h4>
		<p>When you click the Open Deck button in the <a href="#m-app-header">app header</a>, the decks menu appears. It lists of all of your currently unopened decks, in alphabetical order by name, that are <a href="#m-storage-of-deck-data">stored</a> in MTG Deck Builder. Beside each deck’s name are the symbols of the mana colors required by the deck’s spells.</p>
		<p>Each deck listed in the decks menu is a link that takes you to the respective <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a>.</p>
		<p>When you start MTG Deck Builder for the first time ever, it provides two sample decks (“Boros Equipment” and “Sultai Ramp”). You may modify these decks however you like or delete them.</p>
		<p>If all decks in the app have been deleted, the Open Deck button in the app header becomes temporarily disabled.</p>
