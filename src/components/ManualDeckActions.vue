		<h4>Deck Actions</h4>
		<p>Positioned beside the card sorter section is the deck actions section. It has a drop-down menu from which you can choose to do special actions to the deck you’re currently viewing.</p>
		<p>The options for deck actions include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5>Copy</h5>
				<p>Creates a new deck with an identical list of cards as the active deck at the time of copying. The deck copy is automatically given the same name as the origin deck, except that a unique number within parentheses is appended to the copy’s name. (You always can <a href="#m-deck-name">rename</a> it later.)</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Export</h5>
				<p>Generates a <a href="#m-deck-data-files">deck data file</a> of the active deck, which gets saved on your computer or device to wherever your web browser puts downloads. The file is named after your deck’s name, and has “.deck” as its file extension.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Delete</h5>
				<p>Permanently erases the active deck from the app. (If you’d later try to access the URL that belonged to the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> of a deleted deck, then you’d be redirected to a “Page Not Found” error page instead.)</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Whenever you select any deck action option, the app asks you to confirm the action before proceeding, allowing you to cancel.</p>
