		<h4>Sideboard Header</h4>
		<p>This section is a brown banner with the word “Sideboard” on it. Though it’s normally hidden, it becomes visible above the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a> while the <a href="#m-group-toggler">card group toggler</a> is set to the sideboard option.</p>
		<p>The sideboard header also shows the total number of cards contained within your deck’s sideboard. If there are more than 15 cards, which is the maximum limit for sideboards according to <i>Magic</i>’s rules, then a warning symbol (⚠) appears beside the total.</p>
