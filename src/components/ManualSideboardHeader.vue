		<h4>Sideboard Header</h4>
		<p>This section is a brown banner with the heading “Sideboard.” Though it’s normally hidden, it’ll appear above the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a> while the sideboard option is selected in the <a href="#m-group-toggler">card group toggler</a>.</p>
		<p>The sideboard header also shows the total number of cards contained in your deck’s sideboard. If there are more than 15 cards, which is the maximum limit for sideboards according to <i>Magic</i>’s rules, then a warning symbol (⚠) appears beside the total.</p>
