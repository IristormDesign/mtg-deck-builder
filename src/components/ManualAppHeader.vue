		<h3>App Header</h3>
		<p>At the top of every page of MTG Deck Builder is the app header, which has the following buttons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>User Manual</strong> – Takes you to what you’re reading right now.</li>
			<li><strong>Create Deck</strong> – Takes you to the <a href="#m-create-deck">Create Deck</a> page.</li>
			<li><strong>Open Deck</strong> – Makes a menu appear with an alphabetically ordered list of the names of all your unopened decks stored in the app. Beside each deck name are that deck’s mana colors. Click on any deck name in the list to open that <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck’s page</a>. (If all decks in the app have been deleted, the Open Deck button becomes temporarily disabled.)</li>
