		<h3>“Create Deck” Page</h3>
		<p>The Create Deck page is where you can start on a new deck or import a deck data file. Either method will add the deck to the menu that lists all your decks stored in MTG Deck Builder, accessible from the Open Deck button in the <a href="#m-app-header">app header</a>.</p>
		<p>If you choose to start a new deck, you first give it a name, and then the app will take you to an empty <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> for that deck. (If you happen to submit a name that another one of your decks in the app already has, you’ll be asked to give a different name instead.)</p>
		<p>Alternatively, if you have a <a href="#m-deck-data-files">deck data file</a> for MTG Deck Builder, you can open it on the Create Deck page to import its data, and the app will instantly produce a deck page from it.</p>
