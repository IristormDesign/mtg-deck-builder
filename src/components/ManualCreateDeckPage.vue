		<h3>“Create Deck” Page</h3>
		<p>The Create Deck page is where you can start on a new deck or import a deck data file. Either method adds the deck to the <a href="#m-decks-menu">decks menu</a>.</p>
		<p>If you choose to start a new deck, you first give a name for it, and then the app takes you to an empty <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> for that deck. (If you happen to submit a name that another one of your decks in the app already has, you’ll be asked to give a different name instead.)</p>
		<p>Alternatively, if you have a <a href="#m-deck-data-files">deck data file</a> for MTG Deck Builder, you can open it on the Create Deck page to import its data, and the app instantly produces a deck page from it.</p>
