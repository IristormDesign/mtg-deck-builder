		<h4>Symbols</h4>
		<p>MTG Deck Builder displays some of its own symbols to represent <i>Magic</i>’s game elements. They appear in multiple areas of the app, especially on <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck pages</a>.</p>
		<p>The symbols of colored mana are single letters instead of their standard graphics as seen on the cards. Matching Wizards of the Coast’s convention for representing colored mana in plain text, the symbols are the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>White – “W”</li>
			<li>Blue – “U”</li>
			<li>Black – “B”</li>
			<li>Red – “R”</li>
			<li>Green – “G”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The symbols of card rarity levels are the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Common – black “C”</li>
			<li>Uncommon – silver “U”</li>
			<li>Rare – golden “R”</li>
			<li>Mythic rare – orange “M”</li>
			<li>Special – purple “S”</li>
		</ul>
