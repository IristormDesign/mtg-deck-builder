		<h4>Card Group Toggler</h4>
		<p>Each deck in the app has two certain groups of cards: the main deck and the sideboard. These groups are independent of each other, and only one is active on the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> at a time.</p>
		<p>The card group toggler section has a pair of buttons that lets you switch between the main deck and sideboard. Particularly the <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a> and <a href="#m-card-adder">card adder</a> work with the group thatâ€™s currently selected in the toggler.</p>
		<p>Whenever you arrive on any deck page, the active card group is always set to the main deck at first. Whenever you toggle to the sideboard, the <a href="#m-sideboard-header">sideboard header</a> appears.</p>
