		<h4>Card Group Toggler</h4>
		<p>Each deck in the app has two certain groups of cards: main and sideboard. These groups are independent of each other, and only one is active on the <a href="#m-deck-pages">deck page</a> at a time.</p>
		<p>The card group toggler section has a pair of buttons that lets you switch between your deck’s main and sideboard groups. The <a href="#m-card-list">card list</a> and <a href="#m-card-adder">card adder</a> work for the group that’s currently selected in the toggler.</p>
		<p>Whenever you arrive on any deck page, the card group is always set to main at first. Whenever you toggle to the sideboard, the <a href="#m-sideboard-header">sideboard header</a> appears.</p>
