		<h3>Deck Pages</h3>
		<p>Deck pages are the central focus of MTG Deck Builder: They’re where you construct, analyze, test, and publish your custom <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> decks.</p>
		<p>Every deck in the app has its own deck page. Whenever you <a href="#create-deck">create</a> or <a href="#deck-menu">open</a> a deck, you’re directed to its deck page.</p>

		</p>
		<p>A deck page’s contents has two major sections—the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page header</a> and the <a href="#deck-page-modes">deck page mode</a> section—and both are subdivided into sections of their own. The next chapters of this user manual explain in detail every part of a deck page.</p>
		<p>Whenever you’re viewing a deck page, you’re optionally able to use special <a href="#keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>, which let you do commands by pressing keys on a keyboard.</p>

		<section id="deck-page-modes">
			<h4>Deck Page Modes</h4>
			<p>A <a href="#deck-pages">deck page</a> can be set to any one of four deck page modes at a time. These modes are the “<a href="#list-editor">List Editor</a>,” the “<a href="#stats-analyzer">Stats Analyzer</a>,” the “<a href="#draw-sim">Draw Simulator</a>,” and the “<a href="#text-renderer">Text Renderer</a>,” and each provides you a different way to interact with your decks in MTG Deck Builder.</p>
			<p>Later chapters of this user manual explain in detail how each deck page mode works.</p>
			<p>A mode’s contents appears below the <a href="#deck-page-header">deck page’s header</a>. Whenever you arrive on any deck page, the mode displayed first is the List Editor.</p>
			<p>Switch from one mode to another by using the <a href="#mode-menu">mode menu</a> or a <a href="#kbsc-deck-page-modes">keyboard shortcut</a>.</p>
